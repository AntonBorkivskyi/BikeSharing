The most popular stations are all located in the economic and administrative centre of New York - Manhattan.
Such stations mainly located at crossroads of main streets, such as Broadway, 8 Ave & W 31 St, 8 Ave & W 33 St, University Pl & E 14 St, or at very lively places.
Those are Pershing Square North(nearby there is Grand Central Terminal), crossroads of 8 Ave(nearby there is Pennsylvania Station), Central Park, World Trade Center, etc.
The least popular stations mainly located outside Manhattan or at not lively streets.

There were also missing data: in some rows values of "start station id", "start station name", "end station id", "end station name" columns were undefined.
I've tried to solve this using GoogleMaps API, by getting the name of location by station's latitude and longitude and assign new station id.
But as those stations were not popular and corresponding columns were not used in further work, the results are not included in the project.
